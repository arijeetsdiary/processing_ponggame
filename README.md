A Pong Game (Bouncing Ball) created using the Processing.

## Description
When run, a screen of size of 640pixel by 480pixel (resizeable) pops up. A ball is thrown into the screen from the left side of the screen, each time from a different random height and the ball follows a trajectory path. There is a slider which is designed as a hat of DJ Marshmello. Marshmello winks if the hat is taken to either extreme left or right. The ball bounces off the hat and the ground but never exits the screen. The background consists of many static  and dynamic objects.

## Improvements
The game could be modified such that it awards scores each time the ball bounces off the hat (5 points each time for example) and the game is over when the ball touches the ground and prompt the user for another game.
